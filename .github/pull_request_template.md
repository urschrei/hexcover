Thanks for opening a PR. Please read the following:

- **Base your changes on the `dev` branch**
    - If necessary, rebase against `dev` before opening a pull request
- Follow [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). I currently periodically run [`Black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) against the codebase and perhaps you should, too
- Use spaces for indentation, and ensure that all methods have a proper docstring. **Please don't use Doctest**
- If at all possible, don't add dependencies
    - If it's unavoidable, ensure that the dependency is maintained, and supported
    - Ensure that you add your dependency to [setup.py](setup.py)
- Run the tests, and ensure that they pass. If you're adding a feature, **you must add tests that exercise it**
- If your pull request is a feature, **document it**
- One feature per pull request
- If possible, [squash](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits) your commits before opening a pull request, unless it makes no sense to do so
- If in doubt, comment your code.
